# Machine ðŸ“ 

Machine is a collection of scripts to set up macOS for "pro-use" and software development.

The [main script](#usage) is idempotent, i.e. it can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Usage

Clone the repository (`git` is available on all recent macOS versions from the start):

```sh
git https://github.com/janw/machine.git
cd machine
```

Review the scripts (avoid running scripts you haven't read!)

Run it!

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/machine.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/machine.log
```
